# ABSTRACT: Remove all files in the current directory (with options)
# PODNAME: rmhere

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In a directory with many files which you want to delete:

 % rmhere -f

Delete recursively, set location:

 % rmhere -Rf --here /tmp/files

Don't actually delete files, only show:

 % rmhere -f --dry-run

Only delete files matching a wildcard:

 % rmhere --nodir -R --match '*.txt'


=head1 DESCRIPTION

When deleting many files in a directory (thousands, millions), the venerable
L<rm> Unix command is rather cumbersome to use. If you issue C<rm *> the shell
will usually complain with "Argument list too long" because it expands the
wildcard first. You can also use C<< find ./ -type f -maxdepth 1 -delete >>.
This B<rmhere> command is equivalent to that, with some extra options and
features:

=over

=item * Progress report

=item * Dry-run

Just set DRY_RUN=1 or C<--dry-run> to enter dry-run (simulation) mode.

=item * Recursive option

Using C<-R>.
